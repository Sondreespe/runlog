# runlog
A private app to keep track of mye runs, swims and cycling.
It isfull stack development, with a local MongoDB database, and a react to build the app

This project was made to inhance my skills as a fullstack developer and to gloryfy my training data. Sure strave is fine but here i can customize and spescify the sessions to showcase my data the way i like it. If i want to get an overview of my training blocks i can create it here.

Its still in development but it can track session and log them for now. I want to make a new UI for the visualization of training overs over time and make it possible to create training blocks.
